# Action Plan: Backend (Python) and Frontend (React) Connection

This document outlines the steps to connect the Python backend (job scraper) with the React frontend.

## 1. Backend Setup (Python)

**Objective:** Expose the functionality of `get_links.py` and `apply.py` scripts via a REST API.

### 1.1. Dependency Installation

*   **Action:** Ensure Flask, Flask-CORS, Selenium, and beautifulsoup4 are installed in the Python environment.
*   **Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` (after creating/updating `requirements.txt` and activating `venv`).
*   **Status:** **COMPLETED** (Dependencies installed via `requirements.txt` within a `venv`).

### 1.2. Flask Server Creation (`server.py`)

*   **Action:** The `server.py` file has been created in the project root.
*   **Status:** **COMPLETED** (Content provided in the previous step).
*   **Key Points:**
    *   Defines two endpoints: `/api/get_links` (POST) and `/api/apply` (POST).
    *   Utilizes `flask_cors` to allow requests from the frontend.
    *   Imports and calls the `get_job_links` (from `get_links.py`) and `auto_apply_to_job` (from `apply.py`) functions.

### 1.3. Verification and Refactoring of Original Python Scripts

*   **Action:** Confirmed that the `get_job_links` and `auto_apply_to_job` functions in `get_links.py` and `apply.py` respectively, are importable and correctly refactored.
*   **Status:** **COMPLETED** (`get_links.py` and `apply.py` have been refactored and corrected).

### 1.4. Backend Server Execution

*   **Action:** Start the Flask server to listen for requests.
*   **Command:** `python server.py`
*   **Status:** **COMPLETED** (Server is running successfully on `http://localhost:5000`).
*   **Note:** The server will run on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

### 1.5. Git Ignore Configuration

*   **Action:** Created a `.gitignore` file to exclude `venv/`, `node_modules/`, `*.log`, and other common development artifacts from version control.
*   **Status:** **COMPLETED**

## 2. Frontend Integration (React)

**Objective:** Enable the React application to communicate with the Python backend and display results.

### 2.1. Identification of Key Components

*   **Action:** Determined which React components (`App.tsx`) implement the logic for interacting with the backend.
*   **Status:** **COMPLETED**

### 2.2. HTTP Request Implementation

*   **Action:** Added code in `App.tsx` to make `POST` requests to the backend endpoints (`/api/get_links` and `/api/apply`) using the `fetch` API.
*   **Status:** **COMPLETED**

### 2.3. Data Handling and UI

*   **Action:** Updated the state of React components with data received from the backend (displaying job links, application status, and logs).
*   **Status:** **COMPLETED**

### 2.4. Frontend Build Script Configuration

*   **Action:** Added the `scripts` section to `package.json` to enable `npm start` and other standard React commands.
*   **Status:** **COMPLETED**

## 3. Testing and Debugging

**Objective:** Ensure that communication between frontend and backend works correctly.

### 3.1. Backend Testing

*   **Action:** Use a tool like Postman, Insomnia, or `curl` to send requests to the Flask endpoints and verify that they respond as expected.
*   **Status:** **PENDING** (Can be done manually by user if desired, or we can guide through it).

### 3.2. Frontend-Backend Integration Testing

*   **Action:** Ran the React application and tested the full functionality (submitting forms, receiving and displaying data).
*   **Status:** **COMPLETED** (User confirmed visual functionality).

## 4. Additional Considerations (Future)

*   **Error Handling:** More robust error handling implementation on both sides.
*   **Environment Variables:** Use of environment variables for the backend URL.
*   **Deployment:** Strategies for deploying the backend and frontend in production.
*   **Security:** Authentication, input validation, etc.
