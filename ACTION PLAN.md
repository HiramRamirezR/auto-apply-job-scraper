# Action Plan: Backend (Python) and Frontend (React) Connection

This document outlines the steps to connect the Python backend (job scraper) with the React frontend.

## 1. Backend Setup (Python)

**Objective:** Expose the functionality of `get_links.py` and `apply.py` scripts via a REST API.

### 1.1. Dependency Installation

*   **Action:** Ensure Flask, Flask-CORS, and Selenium are installed in the Python environment.
*   **Command:** `pip install Flask Flask-CORS selenium`

### 1.2. Flask Server Creation (`server.py`)

*   **Action:** The `server.py` file has been created in the project root.
*   **Status:** **COMPLETED** (Content provided in the previous step).
*   **Key Points:**
    *   Defines two endpoints: `/api/get_links` (POST) and `/api/apply` (POST).
    *   Uses `flask_cors` to allow requests from the frontend.
    *   Imports and calls the `get_job_links` (from `get_links.py`) and `auto_apply_to_job` (from `apply.py`) functions.

### 1.3. Verification and Refactoring of Original Python Scripts

*   **Action:** Confirm that the `get_job_links` and `auto_apply_to_job` functions in `get_links.py` and `apply.py` respectively, are importable and do not have logic within their `if __name__ == '__main__':` blocks that prevents their use as library functions. If necessary, refactor so that the main logic is in separate functions that can be imported.
*   **Status:** **PENDING** (Requires manual review of `get_links.py` and `apply.py`).

### 1.4. Backend Server Execution

*   **Action:** Start the Flask server to listen for requests.
*   **Command:** `python server.py`
*   **Status:** **PENDING** (To be done after script verification).
*   **Note:** The server will run on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

## 2. Frontend Integration (React)

**Objective:** Enable the React application to communicate with the Python backend and display results.

### 2.1. Identification of Key Components

*   **Action:** Determine which React components (`App.tsx`, `inde.tsx`, or others) will implement the logic for interacting with the backend (e.g., input forms, action buttons, results display).
*   **Status:** **PENDING** (Requires review of the frontend structure).

### 2.2. HTTP Request Implementation

*   **Action:** Add code to React components to make `POST` requests to the backend endpoints (`/api/get_links` and `/api/apply`) using the `fetch` API or a library like `axios`.
*   **Status:** **PENDING**
*   **Key Points:**
    *   Send necessary data (e.g., `job_title`, `location` for `get_links`; `job_link`, `resume_path` for `apply`) in the request body as JSON.
    *   Handle server responses (success, error).

### 2.3. Data Handling and UI

*   **Action:** Update the state of React components with data received from the backend (e.g., display the list of job links, application confirmation messages).
*   **Status:** **PENDING**
*   **Key Points:**
    *   Display loading, success, and error messages to the user.
    *   Dynamically render results.

## 3. Testing and Debugging

**Objective:** Ensure that communication between frontend and backend works correctly.

### 3.1. Backend Testing

*   **Action:** Use a tool like Postman, Insomnia, or `curl` to send requests to the Flask endpoints and verify that they respond as expected.
*   **Status:** **PENDING**

### 3.2. Frontend-Backend Integration Testing

*   **Action:** Run the React application and test the full functionality (submit forms, receive and display data).
*   **Status:** **PENDING**

## 4. Additional Considerations (Future)

*   **Error Handling:** More robust error handling implementation on both sides.
*   **Environment Variables:** Use of environment variables for the backend URL.
*   **Deployment:** Strategies for deploying the backend and frontend in production.
*   **Security:** Authentication, input validation, etc.
